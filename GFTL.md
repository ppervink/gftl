﻿This project is based on [HackerBox 0036 - JumboTron](https://hackerboxes.com/collections/past-hackerboxes/products/hackerbox-0036-jumbotron)I started with the code found in the attached Jumotrondemo.ino found [here](https://www.instructables.com/id/HackerBox-0036-JumboTron/).  Then I proceeded to make a cheezy game.With this project I got as far as making basic JoyStick controls when I concluded that what I had was really addictive and super challenging.  So, I put a little bit of polish on it (emphasis on 'little bit') and decided to leave it as-is for simplicity and the raw fun of it.The controls are simple.  Press any button to get off the title screen.  Press K3 (bottom button) to GO (fast) and use the JoyStick to turn (left - right works, but will almost definitely make you crash).  Score is based on the lap you're on and the number of lives you have (each iteration of the game loop with K3 pressed adds the product of those two).
